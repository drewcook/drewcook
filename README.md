# Hi, I'm Drew (dco) 🤙🏼

I'm a fullstack developer working in Web3 🚀

Currently, I'm building [Alkimiya Protocol][0] with a stellar team! We are creating financial markets around blockspace primitives like Bitcoin transaction fees and Ethereum base gas fees ⏳

### Some impact I've made previously:
- Full-time core contributor to the [Aave Protocol][1], on the app interface and developer SDKs
- Built a winning ETHDenver '22 hackathon project with the [Arbor Protocol][2], a collaborative music NFT platform with royalties
- Graduated from [Zero-Knowlege University][3] as part of Cohort 3
- Joined HarmonyZKDAO with an incubation project using ZK, allowing DAO members to contribute to and get paid through Coordinape
- Launched an NFT collection with [Enlightened Lizards][4] to tap into an existing micro-economy/community around a musical artist
- Have done smart contract auditing through the [Secure3][5] platform, mostly defi projects
- I've even implemented dark mode on [Vitalik's blog][6] (Check out his [tweet][7]) 🆒

I really enjoy working on open-source projects and being a part of the Ethereum community 💪

When I'm not writing code, I write and produce music in my spare time
