# Hi, I'm Drew ü§ôüèº

I'm a fullstack developer working in Web3. :rocket:

Currently, I'm working on the [Alkimiya Protocol][0] ‚è≥, where we are building financial markets around the primitive of blockspace.

Some past impact I've made:
- Full-time core contributor to the [Aave Protocol][1], on the app interface and developer SDKs
- Built a winning ETHDenver '22 hackathon project with the [Arbor Protocol][2], a generative music-making NFT platform with royalties baked in
- Graduated from [Zero-Knowlege University][3] as part of Cohort 3
- Launched an NFT collection with [Enlightened Lizards][4] to tap into an existing micro-economy/community around a musical artist
- Have done smart contract auditing through the [Secure3][5] platform
- I've even implemented dark mode on [Vitalik's blog][6] (Check out his [tweet][7])

I really enjoy working on open-source projects and being a part of the Ethereum community. üí™

I'm interested in a couple areas:
- Blockspace Markets (Alkimiya)
- ZKPs: Researching and working with zero-knowledge technologies and the new crop of use-cases that they can serve
- Music NFTs - I am a long-time musician and producer outside of engineering, and I believe theres a market to build in here

When I'm not writing code, I write and produce music in my spare time, creating sounds like [this][8] and [this][9].
