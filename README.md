# about me

the world needs better systems in place. decentralized blockchain networks solve this.

i'm currently building frontends at [Noble](https://noble.xyz).

### some impact i've made so far:
- implemented dark mode on [Vitalik's blog][6] (check out his [tweet][7])
- full stack development for [Alkimiya][0], a novel defi market centered around network usage
- a core contributor to the [Aave Protocol][1], on the app interface and developer SDKs
- built a winning hackathon project at ETHDenver2022 with the [Arbor Protocol][2], a collaborative music NFT platform with royalties
- graduated from [Zero-Knowlege University][3] as part of Cohort 3
- joined HarmonyZKDAO with an incubation project using ZK, allowing DAO members to contribute to and get paid through Coordinape
- launched an NFT collection with [Enlightened Lizards][4] to tap into an existing micro-economy/community around a musical artist
- smart contract auditing through the [Secure3][5] platform, mostly DeFi projects

i really enjoy working on open-source projects and being a part of the Ethereum community

when I'm not writing code, i write and produce music in my spare time - check out my [Audius][10] page
