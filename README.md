# Hi, I'm Drew ü§ôüèº

I'm a fullstack developer working in Web3. :rocket:

Currently, I'm working on the [Alkimiya Protocol][10], where we are building financial markets centered around blockspace. You can read about our product [here][11].

In the past, I have been a full-time core contributor to the [Aave Protocol][0], contributed to a winning ETHDenver hackathon project with the [Arbor Protocol][2] (a generative music-making NFT platform with royalties), launched a music community based NFT collection with [Enlightened Lizards][12], and spend some time doing smart contract auditing through the [Secure3][9] platform. I even implemented the dark mode on [Vitalik's blog][6]! (Check out his [tweet][1] and the PRs [one][7] & [two][8])

I really enjoy working on open-source projects and within the Ethereum community. üí™

Outside of DeFi, I'm interested in a couple areas:
- ZKPs: Researching and working with zero-knowledge technologies. I have recently graduated from [Zero-Knowlege University][3].
- Music NFTs - I am a long-time musician and producer outside of engineering, and I believe theres a market to fill here.

And when I'm not writing code, I write and produce music in my spare time, creating sounds like [this][4] and [this][5].

Check out my [Audius][13] page! üé∏
