# Hi, I'm Drew ü§ôüèº

I'm a fullstack developer working in Web3. :rocket:

I'm currently working full-time as a core contributor to the Aave Protocol, and a contributor of a few other projects, including doing dark mode on [Vitalik's blog][1].

Outside of DeFi, I'm really interested in a couple areas:
- Music NFTs: Building out the [Arbor Protocol][2], a generative music-making NFT platform with royalties
- ZKPs: Researching and working with zero-knowledge technologies. I have recently graduated from [Zero-Knowlege University][3].

I also write and produce music in my spare time, like [this][4] and [this][5].
